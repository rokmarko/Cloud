# Dashboard Events Page - Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: Owner Section Events Page

### What Was Added

I have successfully added a new **Device Events** page under the Owner section of the dashboard. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. Dashboard Route (`src/routes/dashboard.py`)

#### ✅ Added Event Import
- Added `Event` to the imports from `src.models`

#### ✅ Added Events Route (`/dashboard/events`)
- **URL**: `/dashboard/events`
- **Features**:
  - Pagination (50 events per page)
  - Device filtering (dropdown to filter by specific device)
  - Event type filtering (dropdown to filter by event type)
  - Order by newest events first (highest page_address)
  - Only shows events from user's own devices
  - Event statistics with counts by type

#### ✅ Key Functionality:
```python
@dashboard_bp.route('/events')
@login_required
def events():
    # Get user's devices only
    # Filter by device and/or event type
    # Paginate results (50 per page)
    # Calculate event type statistics
    # Order by page_address DESC (newest first)
```

### 2. Template (`templates/dashboard/events.html`)

#### ✅ Material Design Interface
- **Statistics Cards**: 6 colorful cards showing event counts
  - Total Events (blue)
  - Takeoffs (green) 
  - Landings (yellow)
  - Flying (info blue)
  - Engine Starts (gray)
  - Alarms (red)

#### ✅ Filtering Interface
- **Device Filter**: Dropdown with all user's devices
- **Event Type Filter**: Dropdown with all event types
- **Filter/Clear Buttons**: Apply filters or clear all filters

#### ✅ Events Table
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Columns**:
  - Date/Time (formatted date and time)
  - Device (with icon and device type)
  - Page Address (code formatting)
  - Duration (formatted as minutes/seconds)
  - Active Events (colored badges for each event type)

#### ✅ Event Type Badges
- **Color-coded badges** for different event types:
  - Takeoff: Green
  - Landing: Yellow  
  - Flying: Blue
  - Engine Start: Gray
  - Engine Stop: Dark
  - Alarm: Red
  - Engine Running: Primary blue
  - Others: Light gray

#### ✅ Pagination
- **Bootstrap pagination** with Previous/Next links
- **Page numbers** with current page highlighted
- **Preserves filters** across page navigation

#### ✅ Empty State
- **User-friendly message** when no events found
- **Different messages** for:
  - No devices configured
  - No events match filters
  - No events synced yet

### 3. Navigation (`templates/base.html`)

#### ✅ Added Navigation Link
- **Location**: Under "Owner" section in sidebar
- **Icon**: Material Icons "flash_on" 
- **Label**: "Device Events"
- **Active State**: Highlights when on events page

### 4. Testing (`test_dashboard_events.py`)

#### ✅ Comprehensive Testing

- **Filtering**: Tests event type and device filtering
- **Statistics**: Verifies event counts by type
- **Database Operations**: Tests queries and cleanup
- **Result**: ✅ All tests pass
